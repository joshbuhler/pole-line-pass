# About pole-line-pass
Scripts, info, and other stuff used by the team at the Wasatch 100 Pole Line Pass communications station.

## Resources
There are a few things in the `_resources` folder that are somewhat useful. Here's what you'll find:

### ax_logs
A collection of log file captured using axlisten during testing of the packet rig. Examples of the commands and responses used during a race. However, these logs are only from a testing session, not during the actual race.

### packet_rig
Docs and other instructions for the packet system rig. How to start it up, connect it to the W100 system, etc.

### race_details
Info relating to the race itself. GPX files of the course, descriptions and mileage of the aid stations, and anything else useful relating to the race portion of the event.

### race_forms
Printable forms used by the checkpoint staff during the race.

### system_info
Information about the W100 runner tracking system. Most of this info is taken from [www.ke7bme.com](http://www.ke7bme.com/), and the latest versions can be found there. Some of the stuff in this folder has been customized for readability.
