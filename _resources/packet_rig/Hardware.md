# Hardware Notes

## Power
This system can run on 120VAC or 12VDC power. On the back of the rig are two connectors, a 120VAC three-prong connector, and a 12VDC Anderson connector.

To connect power, first make sure that all power switches on the back panel are set to the OFF state.

### 120VAC

To run using 120V:
1. Ensure that all power switches on the back panel are set to the OFF state.
2. Connect a three-prong power cable to the connector.
3. Flip the center switch towards the AC connector.
4. Switch the AC connector on.
5. The rig should boot up.

### 12VDC

To run using 12V:
1. Ensure that all power switches on the back panel are set to the OFF state.
2. Connect a 12V power supply to the Anderson connector.
3. Flip the center switch towards the 12V Anderson connector.
4. The rig should boot up.

Basically, just make sure that all switches are off to start, then depending on the type of power supplied, switch the metal selector switch to the ON position towards the connector (AC or DC) you're supplying the power with.

## Keyboard / Mouse

There is a USB extension cable sitting above the radio chassis in the back of the rig. There are two ports for a keyboard & mouse.

## Radio

The radio is a Yaesu FT-2900. There are a few different repeaters programmed, but the frequencies used for the W100 are stored beginning at preset #2.
